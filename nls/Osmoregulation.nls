; OSMOREGULATION
;; Methods of Function: To model ion-regulatory stress on a scale of 1-10, we can define stress as a function of osmotic difference (abs(agent osmolarity - patch osmolarity)) and agent chloride cell density
;; Chloride cell density can be expressed as a percentage where 10% is minumum (always expressing some chloride cell function) and 100%
