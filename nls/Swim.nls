  ;; --- Modify energy multiplier by hydrodynamic difficulty and efficiency ---
  ;; Higher difficulty → higher cost
  ;; Lower swim-efficiency → higher cost

  set E-swim swim-base * (energy-multiplier ^ beta)  ;; exponential scaling for realism

  ;; --- Deduct swimming cost from total energy ---
