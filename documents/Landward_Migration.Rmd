# Landward Migration Behavior

This section documents the logic and equations underlying landward (upstream) migration. The modeled behavior accounts for the physical challenge of swimming against riverine flows and with tidal flows. Empirically this is very similar to the Landward Migration behavior, with a negative scaling factor instead of positive.

### Patch Variables

| Variable Name | Definition |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| **Velocity** $V_{patch}$ | The along-channel velocity of a given patch, derived from hydrodynamic model inputs, where positive values are in the landward direction and negative values are in the seaward direction. |

### Agent Variables

| Variable Name | Definition |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| **swimming-speed** $V_{agent}$ | The current swimming speed of the agent. |
| **maximum-speed** $V_{max}$ | The maximum sustained speed of the agent. |
| **difficulty-factor** $D_{f}$ | The level of difficulty an agent experiences when swimming. |
| **size** $M_{agent}$ | Size of an agent. |
| **energy** $E_{agent}$ | The total energy an agent has. |
| **swimming-energy-cost** $Swim_{base}$ | The base energy cost of swimming. |
| **net-swimming-cost** $E_{swim}$ | The total energy expenditure for swimming. |

## Swimming Speed

$$
V_{agent} = \frac{V_{max} * E_{agent}}{100} - (-k \cdot |V_{patch}|)
$$

#### Where:

-   $V_{max}$ is the maximum sustained swimming speed of the agent.

-   $V_{patch}$ is the environmental velocity at the agent's current patch.

-   $V_{agent}$ is the effective swimming speed of the agent.

-   $E_{agent}$ is the agent's available energy percentage (0-100%).

-   $k$ is a scaling factor that determines how velocity influences swimming effort.

## Swimming Difficulty

The difficulty factor quantifies the additional energetic burden of swimming against different velocity conditions. In this case, difficulty is calculated using a normalized velocity-based proxy that exponentially scales difficulty from 1-10 between observed flow extremes.

$$D_{f} = 1 + 9 \cdot \left(\frac{\left( \frac{|V_{patch}|}{V_{max} \cdot \left(\frac{M_{agent}}{M_{max}}\right)} \right)^k - V_{min}}{V_{max} - V_{min}}\right)$$

#### Where:

-   $M_{agent}$ is the size of the agent.
-   $M_{max}$ is the maximum size within the agent's population.
-   $V_{max}$ is the maximum swimming speed capability of the agent.
-   $V_{max}$ is the maximum depth-averaged water velocity observed within the simulation.
-   $V_{min}$ is the minimum depth-averaged water velocity observed within the simulation.
-   $V_{patch}$ is the depth-averaged water velocity for the agent's current patch.
-   $D_{f}$ is the swimming difficulty factor.

#### Biological Justification:

-   When $V_{patch} \approx 0$, difficulty is moderate.

-   When $V_{patch} < 0$, difficulty increases because the fish is actively swimming against the current.

-   When $V_{patch} > 0$, difficulty is minimal as fish drift with the current.

## Swimming Movement

During landward migration, agents orient upstream and move forward based on their calculated swimming speed:

$$
\vec{Y}_{t+1} = \vec{Y}_t + V_{agent} \cdot \hat{u}
$$

**Where:**

-   $\vec{Y}_t$ is the agent’s current spatial position.\
-   $\vec{Y}_{t+1}$ is the agent’s updated spatial position after one time step.\
-   $V_{agent}$ is the swimming speed calculated from energy and difficulty.\
-   $\hat{u}$ is the unit vector in the landward direction (0° heading, upstream).

## Energy Expenditure

#### Energy to Swim

Swimming energy cost is determined by the base cost of locomotion scaled by a difficulty factor raised to a power. This allows energy expenditure to increase non-linearly as flow resistance increases.

$$
E_{swim} = Swim_{base} \cdot D_f^{k}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{swim}$ is the energy cost of swimming.\
-   $Swim_{base}$ is the base swimming cost based on agent size.\
-   $D_f$ is the swimming difficulty factor.\
-   $k$ is the scaling exponent, reflecting nonlinear energy demand.

#### Agent Energy Balance

Fish allocate energy efficiently, balancing osmoregulation with other survival functions.

$$ E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{swim} $$

Where:

-   $E_{agent}$ is the current energy available to the agent.\
-   $E_{swim}$ is the energy cost of swimming in this time step.
