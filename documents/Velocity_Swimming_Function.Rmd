# Agent-Based Modeling: Swimming Against Velocity Function

### Patch Variables

| Variable Name | Definition |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| **Velocity** $V_{patch}$ | The along-channel velocity of a given patch, derived from hydrodynamic model inputs, where negative values are in the landward direction and positive values are in the seaward direction. |

### Agent Variables

| Variable Name | Definition |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| **swimming-speed** $V_{agent}$ | The current swimming speed of the agent. |
| **maximum-speed** $V_{max}$ | The maximum sustained speed of the agent. |
| **difficulty-factor** $D_{f}$ | The level of difficulty an agent experiences when swimming. |
| **size** $M_{agent}$ | Size of an agent. |
| **energy** $E_{agent}$ | The total energy an agent has. |
| **swimming-energy-cost** $Swim_{base}$ | The energy cost of swimming. |
| **net-swimming-cost** $E_{swim}$ |  |

## Initialization

## Fish Speed Adjustment

$$
V_{agent} = V_{max} * \frac{E_{agent}}{100} - (k \cdot |V_{patch}|)
$$

Where:

-   $V_{max}$ is the maximum sustained swimming speed.

-   $V_{patch}$ is the environmental velocity at the fish's location.

-   $V_{agent}$ is the effective swimming speed.

-   $E_{agent}$ is the fish's available energy percentage (0-100%).

-   $k$ is a scaling factor that determines how velocity influences swimming effort.

## Swimming Difficulty

The difficulty factor quantifies the additional energetic burden of swimming against different velocity conditions. It scales with the size and swimming capability of the agent.

$$D_f = \left( \frac{|V_{patch}|}{V_{max}} \right)^\beta$$
Where:

-   $M_{agent}$

-   $V_{max}$

-   $V_{patch}$

-   $D_{f}$

-   $\beta$

#### Biological Justification:

-   When $V_{patch} \approx 0$, difficulty is minimal.

-   When $V_{patch} > 0$, difficulty increases because the fish is actively swimming against the current.

-    When $V_{patch} < 0$, difficulty is reduced as fish drift with the current.

## Energy Expenditure

#### Energy to Swim

$$
E_{swim} = Swim_{base}^{D_{f}}
$$

Where:

-   $E_{swim}$

-   $Swim_{base}$

-   $D_{f}$

#### Agent Energy Balance

This equation ensures that fish allocate energy efficiently, balancing osmoregulation with other survival functions.

$$ E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{swim} $$

Where:

-   $E_{agent}$

-   $E_{swim}$
