## Ion-Regulatory Stress

Ion-regulatory stress is modeled as:

$$
S = \frac{|S_{agent} - S_{patch}|}{1 + e^{-(C - C_{mid})}} \times 10
$$

Where: - $S_{agent}$ and $S_{patch}$ represent acclimated salinity levels and environmental salinity, respectively.
- $C$ is the chloride cell density in percent, with $C_{mid}$ defining the midpoint for effective stress buffering.

## Chloride Cell Density

Chloride cell density follows an **exponential acclimation model**:

$$
C(t_{osmo}) = C_{prev} + (C_{max} - C_{prev}) \times (1 - e^{-\alpha t_{osmo}})
$$

Where: - $C_{prev}$ is the chloride density at the previous time step.
- $C_{max}$ is the maximum chloride cell expression under stress.
- $\alpha$ is the acclimation rate constant.
- $t_{osmo}$ represents **time since the last osmoregulation event**.

## Conceptual Formula for Chloride Cell Proliferation

Instead of immediate chloride cell proliferation, it is controlled by:

$$
C = C + \min(\text{proliferation-rate}, C_{max} - C)
$$

Where: - **Proliferation rate** determines the **maximum allowable increase** per time step.
- $C_{max} - C$ ensures that chloride density does not exceed its upper bound.

If the **time since last osmoregulation** exceeds an acclimation threshold, then chloride cell density increases at the **allowed rate**, so:

if "**time-since-last-osmoregulation" \> acclimation-rate (α) [**

$$
C = C + \min(\text{proliferation-rate}, C_{max} - C)
$$]

## Osmoregulation Energy Cost

Energy required for ion regulation:

$$
E_{osmo} = (E_{base} \times C) + (E_{creation} \times C_{tick})
$$

Where: - **E_base** represents the energy cost per chloride cell for maintenance.
- **C** is the current chloride density.
- **E_creation** represents the cost of producing new chloride cells.
- **C_tick** is the number of newly created chloride cells in the current time step.

### Agent Energy Balance

$$
E_{agent} = E_{agent} - E_{osmo}
$$

This equation ensures that fish allocate energy efficiently, balancing osmoregulation with other survival functions.
